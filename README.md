Data Analytics Project
Overview

This project demonstrates end-to-end data analytics workflow, including data loading, cleaning, exploratory analysis, SQL querying, visualization, and reporting. The objective is to derive actionable insights from the dataset and present findings effectively using Power BI and Gamma.

Dataset

Description: The dataset contains customer shopping behavior with fields like Customer ID, Gender, Purchase Amount, Discount Applied, Item Purchased, and Category.

Source: [Provide dataset source if applicable, e.g., Kaggle or internal data]

Format: CSV file (.csv)

Tools & Technologies

Python: Data loading, cleaning, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn: Visualization in Python

SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server): Querying, aggregation, and filtering

Power BI: Interactive dashboard creation

Gamma: Professional presentation creation

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code: Development environment

Steps Performed

Data Loading: Import CSV dataset into Python using Pandas.

Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Summary statistics

Visualizations for trends and patterns

Correlation analysis

SQL Queries:

Aggregations, filtering, and joins

Insights like top customers, purchase patterns, and revenue by category

Dashboard Creation:

Designed interactive dashboards in Power BI

Visualized key metrics and trends

Reporting & Presentation:

Compiled insights into a report

Created a PPT presentation using Gamma

Dashboard

Purpose: Provides a clear view of key metrics like revenue by gender, top-selling products, discount impact, and customer behavior trends.

Features:

Donut charts for gender distribution

Bar charts for top products

KPIs for revenue and average purchase amount

Results / Insights

Identified top 5 products with the highest sales.

Determined customer segments with maximum revenue contribution.

Found patterns in discount usage and purchase behavior.

Highlighted trends for targeted marketing strategies.

How to Run

Python & EDA:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
jupyter notebook


Load dataset and run notebook cells sequentially.

SQL Queries:

Connect to your database (PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQL Server)

Execute SQL scripts to analyze data.

Power BI Dashboard:

Import cleaned CSV or connect to SQL database

Build visualizations as per provided templates.

Report & Presentation:

Export insights and charts to Gamma

Generate a professional presentation for stakeholders.

Note: Ensure that Python, SQL, and Power BI environments are properly set up. The dataset path and credentials should be updated in the code/notebooks as needed.
